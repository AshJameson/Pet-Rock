We finished milestone 3. We made a complete sandbox for your dead rocks with a transition sequence, a functioning camera system and several assets for the rock, including hats. Transitions between all pages were added. The creation screen was finalized allowing you to name the rock and pushing back to the home page after creating the rock. We added images for the rocks on all pages that it appears. We still need to implement the app loading into the creation screen when you donâ€™t have a rock yet (aka your first launch of the app), this will be implemented next. We also still need to add an overlay of our rock image to the camera function. Other than that all the pages function as intended without bugs.
