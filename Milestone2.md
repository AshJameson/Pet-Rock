We completed milestone 2. We completed the basic function for the camera tab. Adding the rock overlay will be added next here. In addition to this we have updated the tabs to work more as intended. The graveyard now has a scrollable view showing dead rocks and their names. The creation page features a box for entering your rocks name upon taping your selected rock. Basic data persistence has been added, this will be expounded upon for the next milestone. All of the tabs work as intended with very few bugs.
