We completed milestone 1. We completed the basic layouts for all of our tabs and have lists in the game's model to represent choices of food and hat. In addition to this the status of the pet rock is operating as intended with choosing to feed the rock appropriately draining health. This is represented with status bars on the main screen. One minor issue of note with the home page is that one element only appears in landscape mode. Otherwise all layouts are fully functional in both portrait and landscape mode and the model appropriately tracks and updates data.
